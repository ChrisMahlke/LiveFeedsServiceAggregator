The elapsed property specifically measures the time taken between sending the first byte of the request and finishing parsing the headers. It is therefore unaffected by consuming the response content.  The current default elapsed response threshold (in seconds) is set to 2 seconds.  It's worth noting, the elapsed time fluctuates dramatically throughout the day from a lower bound of around 0.3 seconds at times, to sometimes an upper bound of 3 seconds in the afternoon.
